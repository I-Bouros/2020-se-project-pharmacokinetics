Pharmacokinetics (PK) is the branch of pharmacology responsible for the study of how different substances interact with living organisms, in particular with the way they are assimilated by said organisms. It provides a quantitative basis for the description of the delivery of a particular drug to a patient, through studying its utake behaviour and how it diffuses in the body over time.

Any drug can have widely contrasting effects on the body depending on the quantity in which the substance is administered. Too little and the effects will not be vsisible due mainly to the difussion of substances that occurs in the body, hence the concentartion of the chemical will be too low in the region that it targets. At the same time, too much of the same chemical and adverse effects will be likely to appear. These mainly occur because the large quatity of the drug may not only have an effect on the particular methabolic pathway you wish to treat, but also on several others, producing too strong shifts in them that unbalance the gentle equilibrium in which they find themselves, causing large scale disruptions with physiological consequences. 

This proves to be essential in the development of new treatments, to ensure a suffient quantity of the active substance is administered to the subject for the medicine to be effective.
